## Container Tech
* [Docker](http://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/image/spec/v1.md) The first and still most popular container technology, Docker's open-source containerization engine works with most of the products that follow, as well as many open-source tools.
* [Docker Enterprise](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-enterprise) This set of extensions not only adds features to Docker, but also makes it possible for Docker (the company) to add commercial support. If you need a support matrix to know exactly which versions of what software are supported—and a phone number to call if things go wrong—then Docker Enterprise might be for you.
* [CRI-O](https://cri-o.io/) The first implementation of the Container Runtime Interface, CRI-O is an incredibly lightweight, open-source reference implementation.
* [rktlet](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/rktlet) The aforementioned rkt, redesigned and retooled to use the CRI as rktlet, now has a set of supported tools and community to rival Docker.
* [containerd](https://www.cncf.io/) A project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, containerd was an early container format. More recently the developers of containerd built a [CRI plugin](https://github.com/containerd/cri) that lets Kubernetes run containerd in the same way it runs rktlet or CRI-O.
* [Microsoft Containers](http://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/deploy-containers/system-requirements) Positioned as an alternative to Linux, Microsoft Containers can support Windows containers under very specific circumstances. They generally run in a true virtual machine and not in a cluster manager like Kubernetes.
* [podman](https://podman.io) The best free & open source container tools

## Cluster management and deployment

* [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) While there is no standard for cluster management, the Kubernetes open-source cluster manager, originally developed by Google, is far and away the most popular. Supported by Amazon's AWS, Google's Cloud Engine (GCE) and Microsoft's Azure Container service, Kubernetes is relatively portable, which helps prevent vendor lock-in. Kubernetes can even run on a private cloud: OpenStack. Microsoft, Amazon, and Google all provide container services that run Kubernetes—with commercial support options available.
* [Istio](https://istio.io/) and [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) Where Kubernetes provides load balancing and scalability, by default it assumes that the same service will run the same version number and that all services can talk to one another. Kubernetes does not provide the tools to debug services that call services—sometimes called "observability." Envoy and Istio are open-source service mesh technologies that add a layer to provide security and observability. They can encrypt traffic inside of the cluster while observing it. Developed by Lyft, Envoy was the first service mesh for Kubernetes. Istio includes Envoy, sits on top of it, and adds several plugins, dashboards, and other features to extend it. 
* [Apache Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/blog/mesos-1-0-0-released/) A tool for abstracting computing resources, Apache Mesos can run both Docker and rkt images side by side in the same cluster. DC/OS is a platform built on Mesos that functions as a data center operating system.
* [Docker Swarm](https://github.com/docker/swarm) Docker's free product for cluster management, Swarm runs from the command line and comes bundled with Docker 1.12 and higher. Swarm does not support autoscaling or load balancing natively, but third-party extensions provide this functionality.
* [Docker Datacenter](https://hub.docker.com/bundles/docker-datacenter) More than just a commercial alternative to Kubernetes, Docker Datacenter is designed as a drop-in replacement that lets you containerize your entire data center, and it includes commercial support. The tool has LDAP integration and a web-based dashboard with control panel, registry, monitoring, logging, and continuous integration. Of course, Docker Datacenter embraces and extends Docker's free, open-source products: Docker and Swarm. The tool adds the load balancing and scaling that Swarm is missing. And, of course, it works with Docker Enterprise.

## Storage containers

* [BlockBridge](http://www.blockbridge.com/) BlockBridge, the "elastic storage platform" company, offers storage as a container using Docker, with support for Kubernetes, OpenStack, and software-defined secure storage.
* [EMC / libstorage](http://github.com/codedellemc/libstorage) The EMC / libstorage system offers a code library to provide container storage that's free and open.
* [Docker plugins for storage]() EMC, NetApp, and others have created plugins to support storage, which Docker Inc. makes available for download.

## Container security

* [Twistlock](http://www.twistlock.com/) You build Docker images out of components, such as an operating system, a web server, or a content management system. The problem is that unpatched or outdated software on an image could harbor security risks. Twistlock's vulnerability scanner addresses that by comparing images against a database of known threats. This is an automated audit against a database that's constantly updated. Other core features include more classic intrusion detection, and regulatory compliance systems.
* [Aqua Container Security](http://www.aquasec.com/) Like Twistlock, Aqua focuses on the ability to create, monitor, and enforce policy for containers, along with integration with continuous integration (CI), running security checks on every build.
* [StackRox](https://twitter.com/sameerbhalotra) Co-founded by Sameer Bhalotra, a former security executive at Google and senior director for cybersecurity in the Executive Office of the President of the United States, StackRox provides Kubernetes cluster discovery. The software examines an entire cluster, comparing how the running containers behave compared to a company's security policies. StackRox allows those policies to be documented and evaluated automatically in code.
* [Aporeto](http://www.aporeto.com/) Aporeto encrypts every workload between containers, providing authentication and authorization. The software also allows you to define security policy programmatically, and to ensure it is enforced.
